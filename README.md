This is a simple web app that creates QR codes for any text or URL. Just enter your text or link, click the "Generate QR Code" button, and the QR code appears instantly. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the QR Server API to generate codes. The design is clean, responsive, and includes smooth animations. If the input field is empty, an error effect appears. You can host this project on GitHub Pages and share the link. Contributions are welcome, and the project is open-source under the MIT License.
